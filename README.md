- 👋 Hi, I’m @Deadlywill I've been putting off learning programming but feel like now is the time to get serious. 
- 👀 I’m interested in playing drums and learning more about developing automated solutions to daily/routine problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, but I quickly get frustrated so this is an on and off again relationship that's rekindled for the 3rd time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any software engineering project (adequate skil-level, currently novice) that will help me learn to instill a good foundation
- 📫 How to reach me at my e-mail address: gdwillz@yahoo.com
